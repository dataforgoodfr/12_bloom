/*
This file is used to create a mart table for number of vessels in MPAs for API routes :
    - /metrics/vessels-count-in-mpas : Return the number of vessels in MPAs between dates
    - /metrics/mpas-visited: Return the number of zones visited between dates

    Fields:
    - day_date: Day of the count
    - vessel_ids: List of vessel IDs that were in MPAs on that day
    - zones_ids: List of MPA zone IDs where vessels were present on that day
    - count_vessels: Number of vessels in MPAs on that day
    - count_zones: Number of unique MPA zones with vessels on that day
    - created_at: Creation timestamp of the record
