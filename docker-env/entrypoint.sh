# The entrypoint.sh script stores ENV vars at runtime in the ~/.env file as key=value pairs
# Then the cron line include some command to load these ENV vars from file before launching app.py
# This mecanism allows to give access to the same ENV vars for app.py launch in terminal and launch via cron
