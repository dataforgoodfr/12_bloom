## Data files and sources

### Hosting

To host large data files directly on github, use Git Large File Storage (https://git-lfs.com/). 

### Documenting

Ideally, when hosting new data files (whether raw data or transforms), makes sure to document the new data file on https://www.notion.so/dataforgood/aec8be0483f74ebea6a1343604bf0fb6?v=81fd132a4e6f42bca41ae52d80f274c0.
