## Data files and sources

### Structure

Relevant data is temporarily stored at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vXXYOel5BLHz6c3IN2YPsuDoX_hMhqr2 (awaiting a more permanent solution from data engineering team).

The G-Drive is subdivided into a `raw` (for data directly obtained from outside sources and "re-hosted" on the drive) 
and a `processed` folder (for datasets we produce from `raw` data). 

For tracability, processed data should ideally be accompanied by the script used to generate it from raw data.

### Documenting

When hosting new data files (whether raw data or transforms), makes sure to document the new data file on https://www.notion.so/dataforgood/aec8be0483f74ebea6a1343604bf0fb6?v=81fd132a4e6f42bca41ae52d80f274c0.
